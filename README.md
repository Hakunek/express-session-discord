# NOTE

This is not original package @types/express-session
I modified it to make Session class include 2 more properties as I'm using it while having fun with Discord's OAuth2
user and guilds

Why I did this?
so I do not have to type `//@ts-ignore` before every line where I use `req.session.user`
YES
I am lazy, feel free to be toxic about it
